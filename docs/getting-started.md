- Verify `.env` contains `BOT_TOKEN`
- Check that `.env` file is in the root directory
- Ensure no extra spaces around the token

**Permission issues**
- Ensure the bot has appropriate permissions in Discord
- Check that bot's role is higher than roles it needs to manage
- See [Discord Setup Guide](discord-setup.md) for required permissions

**Bot not responding**
- Verify bot is online in Discord
- Check hosting service logs for errors
- Ensure bot can see the channel you're typing in

**Reaction roles not working**
- Confirm `PRONOUN_REACTION_POST_ID` matches your message ID
- Verify emoji names match those in the code
- Check bot has "Manage Roles" permission
