## Temperature Conversion Examples

### Automatic Temperature Detection

**User mentions temperature:**
```
User: It's 75¬∞F outside today!
Bot: 75¬∞F = 24¬∞C
```

**Multiple temperatures:**
```
User: The forecast shows 32¬∞F tomorrow and 98¬∞F later this week
Bot: 32¬∞F = 0¬∞C
98¬∞F = 37¬∞C
```

**Celsius to Fahrenheit:**
```
User: Water boils at 100¬∞C
Bot: 100¬∞C = 212¬∞F
```

**Mixed formats:**
```
User: It's 20C here but 85F there
Bot: 20¬∞C = 68¬∞F
85¬∞F = 29¬∞C
```

The bot automatically detects temperature values in various formats:
- `75¬∞F`, `75F`, `75f`
- `24¬∞C`, `24C`, `24c`
- Supports negative temperatures: `-10¬∞C`
